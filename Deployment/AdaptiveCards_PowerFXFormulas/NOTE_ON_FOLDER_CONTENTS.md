# Note on Folder contents

The code within this folder is included in the Solution file that is installed as a part of the deployment process.

It is included here to provide examples of how Adaptive Cards can be dynamically generated using Power FX formulas, and presented to makers and end-users by Copilot Studio agents.

The files are in .txt format as they are the Power FX formulas themselves, rather than the final JSON-based Adaptive Cards. This content would be found in the formula editor input boxes in Copilot Studio, in Topic nodes, or in Action outputs.
