Solution overview
</h2>

The Agents for Enhanced Customer Care solution accelerator leverages agents in the context of customer engagement, to provide delightful customer experiences, and empower agents in the contact center, in the context of a Telecommunications organization. Agent AI capabilities are used to engage directly with customers on the voice/phone channel, as well as to provide contextual and organization-specific insights to contact center employees. This results in increased customer satisfaction, cost reduction and increased revenue for targeted business impact.

The solution accelerator leverages Dynamics 365 Contact Center, Copilot Studio, Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service, and Power Platform as the core components for the solution.

Customers of the organization are able to speak with an AI-powered agent on the voice channel as the first point of interaction. The AI agent understands customer intent and dynamically formulates and executes a plan of action, using Generative AI-based orchestration to assemble the appropriate knowledge, topics, and actions to drive to resolution. When necessary, troubleshooting steps can be dynamically prepared, and stepped through with the customer, personalized to the customer's technical aptitude. If needed, the AI agent seamlessly escalates the conversation to a human customer service representative, where Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service is leveraged to enhance the employee's productivity by giving them intelligently-summarized information about the customer and their conversation with the AI agent, their past interaction history, and natural-language access to organization-specific data and applications. This results in higher agent productivity, and higher customer satisfaction, by reducing the time it takes to resolve the customer call, and increasing the accuracy of the service representative.

**NOTE:** This accelerator is not intended to be a production ready solution. The components can be extended through customization & configuration as desired to create a production ready solution. All components packaged have been done through a unmanaged solution which allows users to be able to customize & extend the components post deployment.

### How to install or deploy

Please click this [**Link to Deployment Guide**](Deployment/README.md) for instructions on how to deploy and set up the solution accelerator.

[**Usage Guidance**](Deployment/Data/USAGE_GUIDANCE.md) has been provided to assist you in executing the steps required to see the included capabilities of this accelerator in action.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Check Azure OpenAI Quota Availability - do not have content**
 <br/>To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow [quota check instructions guide](./docs/QuotaCheck.md) before you deploy the solution.

### Prerequisites and Costs - do not have content
{üü®TODO: Update with solution specific notes like role requirements}

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and  Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./docs/AzureAccountSetUp.md).

Here are some example regions where the services are available: {üü®TODO: Update with suggested regions specific to this solution}

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available.

{üü®TODO: Call out specific pricing "gotchas" like Azure Container Registry if known}

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

{üü®TODO: Update with solution specific estimate sheet}

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. 

Review a [sample pricing sheet](https://azure.com/e/68b51f4cb79a4466b631a11aa57e9c16) in the event you want to customize and scale usage.

_Note: This is not meant to outline all costs as selected SKUs, scaled use, customizations, and integrations into your own tenant can affect the total consumption of this sample solution. The sample pricing sheet is meant to give you a starting point to customize the estimate for your specific needs._

<br/>

{üü®TODO: Update with all products, decription of product use, and product specific pricing links}

| Product | Description | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| [Product Name with Link to Learn content](https://learn.microsoft.com) | Decription of how the product is used | [Pricing]() |
| [Product Name with Link to Learn content](https://learn.microsoft.com) | Decription of how the product is used | [Pricing]() |

Business Use Case
</h2>

Below is an image of the solution accelerator.

![Key Features](./Deployment/Images/solutionoverview.png)

A customer calls the customer support number of their telecommunications service provider to try to resolve an ongoing 5G home internet connectivity issue, and receives a personalized greeting by an AI agent. The customer describes the home internet connectivity issue, and the agent is able to intelligently understand the customer's intent. The AI agent intelligently and dynamically creates an action plan to investigate and resolve the issue. A series of actions are intelligently assembled, to determine if there is a network issue at the customer's network node. Upon identifying that the network is operating as expected, the agent assembles and walks through a set of troubleshooting steps to help identify and resolve the problem on the customer's end. Upon resolution, the AI agent identifies an upsell opportunity that will prevent the issue from impacting the customer in the future, and asks the customer if they would be interested.

Once the customer confirms interest and agrees to speak with a representative, the AI agent transfers the conversation to a contact center employee who receives a Copilot-provided summary of the conversation between the customer & the AI agent, empowering him to best assist the customer. From there, the representative is empowered with organization-specific insights from Copilot, enabling him to use natural language to retrieve data usage history, provision products and services, and take other actions in industry-specific line-of-business applications.

The call is wrapped up with an intelligently-drafted email sent to the customer that summarizes the interaction between the customer, AI agent and representative.
